# In phase,-0-tracks/ruby/iteration.rb, write your own method that takes a block. 
# Your method should print out a status message before and after running the block. 
# Your block doesn't have to do anything fancy -- it can just print out several of its own parameters.

# List of groceries:
# tomatoes
# onions
# milk
# bell pepper
# first status is empty bag, ending status is full bag

# 1. A method that iterates through the items, deleting any that meet a certain condition (for example, deleting any numbers that are less than 5).

#certain condition -- Ruby offers several options!

var = [1, 4, 7, 10, 12]

# 4. A method that will remove items from a data structure until the condition in the block 
# evaluates to false, then stops (you may not find a perfectly working option for the hash, and that's okay).
