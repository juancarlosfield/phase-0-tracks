#Release 0: Equip Your New Robot

## Write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out. For instance, how will your robot figure out which floor button to press? 

- elevator = floor.
- floor = .# + floor.
- scope = lobby(1st floor) < 2nd && 9th < penhouse(10th floor).
- Every button is a floor. 
- lobby button is 1st floor. 
- penhouse button is last floor.
- You only press the button you are told. 
- Each floor is a button. 
- If you are told a # with the word floor right after, press that button.
- when someone enters in the elevator ask, "which floor please?"
- Else adivise "this elevator will remain at the Lobby till further instructions." 
- Always default with Lobby button.
