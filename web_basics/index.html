  <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>

<h2>Mi name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/juancarlos.field">Juan Carlos</a> and I am an amazing coder! </h2>
<h3>But first, let me tell you a little about myself...</h3>
<p>All my life I have dreamed how can I make the World a better place. There is so much poverty, negativity and broken legacies who at some point have been already forgotten by the monopoly of the fittest. I want to create doors of opportunity to the artist, the writter, the single mother, the children with no parents.</p>
<break>
<p>If you like my idea and wanted to be part of the change</p>
<break>
<p>Always remember that...</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Live</em></li>
  <li><em>love</em></li>
  <li><em>laugh</em></li>

</ul>
<h1><strong>Believe it can be done</strong></h1> 
<em>Stay Focused!</em>
